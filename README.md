# Smart Gripper - EESTech Challenge

This is a repository of the code created for the **EESTech Challenge 2025** in Trieste.

[Challenge Description](https://github.com/Infineon/hackathon/blob/master/challenge_introduction.pdf)

### Instructions:

1.  **Angle Alignment:** After flashing this code to the XMC4700 Relax Kit, an angle alignment process will automatically begin. **Crucially, ensure the gripper is fully opened** before flashing. This will release the gears and minimize any load during the alignment procedure.

2.  **Gear Attachment:**
    * Once the angle alignment is complete, manually attach the gears. You may need to slightly close the gripper to ensure proper gear alignment.
